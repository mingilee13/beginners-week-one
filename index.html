  <p>I am currently learning to code with <a href="https://www.codefirstgirls.org.uk/">Code First Girls</a>. Going over everything from how the
    internet works, to creating websites and version control with git. A lot to cover in only <b>8 weeks</b>!
    Everyone should learn to code, here are some pretty good reasons why... </p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML is cool</li>
      <li>CSS is cooler</li>
      <li>JS is the best</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What do you need to create a website?</h2>
    <p>Not much!</p>
    <p>Here are the thing you need</p>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>What you need</th>
        <th>What I use</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A computer</td>
        <td>Always a good start</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A text editor</td>
        <td>I am using atom</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>A web brower</td>
        <td>I am using Chrome</td>
      <tr>
        <td>Some HTML, CSS and JS files</td>
      <tr>
    </table>
